* Studied SOTA models like RNNs, LSTMs, Memory Networks, BiDAF, PointerNet, RaSoR, FastQA in solving the problem of comprehension based QnA on SQuAD and bAbI datasets.
* Implemented MemNNs using keras against the 20 bAbI Q/A tasks on bAbI dataset, like Single Supporting Fact(96.9%), Positional Reasoning(66.9%), Path Finding(13.9%) etc with near state of the art levels of accuracy.
* Implemented (in tensorflow) the FastQA model from the research paper, on SQuAD dataset with appreciable results.
