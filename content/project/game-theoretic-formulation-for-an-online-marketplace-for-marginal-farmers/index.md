* Introduced a novel Extended Trade Reduction Mechanism for a theoretical online marketplace to set up a double auction for multiple agents to trade directly with consumers by submitting bids for the trades.
* Presented a formal modelling of the problem with proofs to preserve the desirable mechanism properties. Also proved that the mechanism tends to an equilibrium with the maximum asymptotic efficiency vs the number of agents
* Developed a simulation and experimentation framework in Python/ C++ using libraries like SimPy, Bokeh etc to supplement our model. Presented our findings on market profits vs net quantity traded, agent trades etc and visualized our mechanism achieving an equilibrium in real time.
