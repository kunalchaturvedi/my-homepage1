* Tackled the problem of Recognition and identification of words in severely cluttered and distorted environments of EZ-GIMPY and GIMPY CAPTCHA using classical Visual recognition techniques (vs Deep Learning techniques).
* Incorporated Lexical information of alphabets using Canny Edge Detection to prune location of letters.
* Implemented Shape Context Recognition from scratch(MATLAB) on character blimps and compared obtained measure with pre-processed templates , employing fast pruning to reduce time complexity, achieving an accuracy of 85%
