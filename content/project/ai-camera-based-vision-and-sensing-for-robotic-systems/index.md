* Studied the feasibility of Computer Vision powered single camera systems, against a suite of sensors for robotics vision ans sensing tasks like object detection, identification, distance estimation and collision avoidance.
* Employed and augmented the YOLO algorithm to execute these tasks in real time (with varying levels of success).
* Compared the results against ultrasonic sensors and proposed how a combination of the two can be used effectively.
